# Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the extension icon. In a real implementation, you would include:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These should be designed as Gmail/email-themed icons with AI elements.

Suggested design elements:
- Mail/envelope icon
- Tabs/folder visual elements
- AI/robot subtle accent
- Gmail color scheme compatibility
- Clean, modern design

You can create these icons using tools like:
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Canva
- GIMP
- Online icon generators

For now, the extension will work without custom icons, using default Chrome extension icons.
