## 📋 **Future Maintenance**

To keep markdown formatting consistent:

1. **Use scripts**: Run the fixing scripts before committing
2. **Editor setup**: Configure your editor with markdown linting
3. **Pre-commit hooks**: Consider adding markdown linting to CI/CD

## 🎉 **Result**

All markdown files now pass linting rules and maintain consistent formatting across the project documentation.
